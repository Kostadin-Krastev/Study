/*
Write a function that takes the look and dimensions of a geometric figure and calculates
its face.
The figures are of four types: square, rectangle, circle, and triangle. The first
parameter is the type of figure (square, rectangle, circle, or triangle). 
- If the figure is a square, the next parameter is a number - the length of its side. 
- If the figure is a rectangle, the next two parameters produce two numbers - the
lengths of its sides. 
- If the figure is a circle, the next parameter is a number - the radius of the circle. 
- If the figure is a triangle, the next two parameters produce two numbers - the
length of its side and the length of the height to it.
Round the result to 2 decimal places.
