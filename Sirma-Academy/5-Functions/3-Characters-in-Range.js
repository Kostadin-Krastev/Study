/*
Explanation for the string middleCharacters and I add characters in it
1. String.fromCharCode(i)
- String.fromCharCode() is a JavaScript method that takes a numeric ASCII code and returns the corresponding character.

- i in this case represents an ASCII code, which comes from the loop iterating between the ASCII values of the two input characters.

- For example, String.fromCharCode(97) would return 'a' because 97 is the ASCII code for the lowercase letter "a".

2. String.fromCharCode(i) + ' '
- String.fromCharCode(i) + ' ' converts the character (like 'a') into a string and appends a single space (' ') after it.

- This space is added so that the output format is nicely spaced, resulting in something like "a b c d " instead of "abcd".

3. result += ...
- result += ... means weâ€™re adding (+=) each generated character and space to the existing content of result.

- Starting with result = '', each iteration appends the next character and a space to result.

/*
trim()
Building the middleCharacters String:

- During each loop iteration, we add a character followed by a space to middleCharacters, so we end up with something like "a b c d ".

- This trailing space is not necessary for the final output, so we use trim() to remove it.

Applying trim():

- When we call middleCharacters.trim(), it removes the space from the end (and the beginning, if there were any).

- The final output becomes "a b c d" (without the trailing space).
